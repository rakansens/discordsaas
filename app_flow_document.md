# Discord BOT Control Center App Flow Document

## Introduction

This document describes the complete user experience for the Discord BOT Control Center application. The application is built to help users manage their Discord bots using a modern web interface. The backend relies on Supabase with PostgreSQL for data storage and real-time updates, and the authentication system is built using NextAuth.js with Discord and Google OAuth. The goal is to offer a seamless, secure, and interactive experience where users can create, control, and monitor their bots, set commands, and even manage file uploads for features such as bot avatars. The design has taken inspiration from Discord’s dark theme while maintaining a clean and adaptable interface that supports both standard users and system administrators.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first navigates to the application, they arrive on a modern landing page that clearly presents the options for signing in and signing up. The landing page provides a clean login interface featuring prominent buttons to authenticate using either Discord or Google. In addition to the OAuth buttons, there is also an option for a standard email and password login for those who prefer this method. During the sign-up process, users are prompted to provide essential details such as their email address and a password if they choose the traditional registration flow. For users who have forgotten their password, a clear option is available that initiates the recovery process. Once the user completes the sign-up or log-in steps, their credentials are validated and a secure session is established using JWT tokens negotiated by NextAuth.js. The result is a smooth transition from authentication to the next stage of the experience.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful authentication, the user is directed to a personalized dashboard that serves as the home page. The layout is designed to be intuitive and role-specific. All users see a navigation menu with access to core features such as the bot management area, command configuration area, and a settings page. The sidebar or header provides quick links to these sections along with an option to toggle between light and dark modes. The dashboard displays important notifications, real-time updates from running bots, and recent activity feeds. This initial landing page clearly differentiates between the experiences of a standard user, who has access solely to their own bots and commands, and a system administrator, who sees a broader set of controls including user management, API usage reporting, and system configuration options.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the dashboard, users interested in managing their bots can move to the bot management section. In this area, users have the option to create new bots or edit existing ones. The bot creation page asks for details such as the bot name, client ID, and a token which is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being stored. After saving a new bot entry, the user is given controls to start or stop the bot, and real-time status is updated immediately through Supabase Realtime. Should the user decide to modify a bot, the same page provides options to update settings like the avatar, which can be uploaded using Supabase Storage, with automatic image resizing and conversion applied as needed.

For users who need to manage bot commands, the transition is seamless from the bot management screen to the command management interface. Here, users can add new commands by entering names, descriptions, usage instructions, and various options. If a command requires an associated prompt, a separate prompt configuration section is available from this page. Changes and new entries are instantly validated and saved to the database, and the system ensures that only authorized bot owners can perform these actions. The app flow also provides access to an administrative interface. For system administrators, after authentication, an additional section appears within the dashboard where they can manage user accounts, monitor overall system performance, adjust configurations, and review usage statistics. Navigation between these sections is smooth, and contextual breadcrumbs guide users through each step of the process.

## Settings and Account Management

The settings page is accessible from the main dashboard through a dedicated link in the navigation menu. In this section, users can update personal information, such as their display name, avatar, and email address. Preferences like notification settings and theme toggles between dark and light modes are also available here. If a user has any billing or subscription details (for additional premium features), they are also managed on this page. Administrative users, when logged in, have additional control within the settings area to enable system-wide configurations, review API usage limits, and adjust other aspects of the application. Once users make and save any changes, they are provided with confirmation and are seamlessly redirected back to the main application flow without disrupting the work in progress.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application handles various error conditions gracefully. If a user enters invalid data during login, sign-up, or while configuring bot settings, clear error messages are displayed that guide them on how to correct the issue. In cases where connectivity is lost, such as during real-time updates or file uploads, the interface notifies the user and suggests refreshing the page or checking their internet connection. When users try to access restricted pages without proper authorization, they are redirected back to the dashboard or shown a relevant error screen that explains the access limitations. These safeguards ensure that errors do not break the overall flow and that users can easily regain control of the application even after interruptions or mistakes.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The entire journey in this application begins with a welcoming sign-in and sign-up process that emphasizes ease of access. After the user verifies their identity through Discord, Google, or traditional email methods, they land on a customizable dashboard tailored to their role. From here, they can manage their bots—creating, editing, and monitoring them in real time—as well as configure commands and prompts to enhance functionality. Administrators benefit from an additional layer of management features that ensure smooth operation of the system. Throughout the process, every action, transition, and error state is designed to provide immediate feedback and maintain a secure and engaging environment. The result is a complete, end-to-end experience that guides users from initial authentication to everyday usage as they control and monitor their Discord bots with confidence and ease.
