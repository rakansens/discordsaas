# Tech Context

## Technology Stack Overview

The Discord Bot Control Center is built using a modern technology stack that emphasizes security, real-time capabilities, and a seamless user experience.

### Frontend Technologies

- **Next.js 14**: Using the App Router architecture for server-side rendering, API routes, and optimized client-side navigation
- **React**: Component-based UI development with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for improved code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and consistent design
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI for accessible, customizable UI elements
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions and interactive elements

### Backend Technologies

- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service platform providing:
  - PostgreSQL database for structured data storage
  - Authentication services integrated with NextAuth.js
  - Storage for file uploads (bot avatars, etc.)
  - Realtime subscriptions for live updates
  - Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless functions for handling API requests
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework supporting Discord OAuth and Google OAuth
- **Discord.js**: Library for interacting with the Discord API and managing bot processes

### Infrastructure

- **Vercel**: Hosting platform for Next.js applications with:
  - Continuous deployment from Git
  - Edge functions for global performance
  - Environment variable management for secure configuration
  - Analytics for monitoring performance

### Third-Party Integrations

- **Discord API**: For OAuth authentication and bot management
- **Google OAuth**: For alternative authentication method
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-powered bot capabilities
- **Perplexity API**: For enhanced search functionality
- **DeepL API**: For translation features
- **Stability AI API**: For image generation
- **Anthropic API**: For alternative AI capabilities
- **Spotify API**: For music integration
- **Twitch API**: For streaming integration
- **YouTube API**: For video integration
- **Sentry**: For error tracking and monitoring

## Development Environment

- **Node.js**: v20.2.1 runtime environment
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript dependencies
- **Git**: Version control system for collaborative development
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE with extensions for TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- **Cursor**: AI-powered code editor for enhanced development experience
- **Windsurf**: Additional AI tooling for development assistance

## Database Schema

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- **users**: User accounts and profile information
- **bots**: Bot configurations and status information
- **commands**: Command definitions linked to bots
- **prompts**: Prompt templates for commands
- **api_connections**: Third-party API credentials
- **logs**: System and bot activity logs

## Security Implementation

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication flow using NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data like bot tokens and API keys
- **Row Level Security**: Supabase RLS policies ensuring users can only access their own data
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of sensitive configuration using Vercel's environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

## API Structure

- **/api/auth/[...nextauth]**: Authentication endpoints managed by NextAuth.js
- **/api/bots**: Bot management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- **/api/commands**: Command configuration endpoints
- **/api/upload**: File upload handling for bot avatars and other assets
- **/api/integrations**: Third-party API integration management

## Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development environment with Supabase local instance
- **Staging**: Vercel preview deployments for testing before production
- **Production**: Vercel production deployment with custom domain
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions or Vercel integration

## Performance Considerations

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Using Next.js SSR for improved initial load times
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image processing for optimized delivery
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for reduced bundle sizes
- **Caching Strategy**: API response caching for frequently accessed data
- **Edge Functions**: Leveraging Vercel's edge network for global performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Vercel Analytics**: Monitoring application performance and user behavior
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and exception monitoring
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Database and storage monitoring
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and audit trails

## Technical Constraints

- **Supabase Limitations**: Working within the constraints of Supabase's free and paid tiers
- **Vercel Serverless Functions**: Function execution time and size limits
- **Discord API Rate Limits**: Managing rate limits for bot operations
- **Third-Party API Costs**: Balancing feature richness with API usage costs
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring support for modern browsers while maintaining performance
